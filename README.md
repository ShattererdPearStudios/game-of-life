# Game of Life

This project intends to implement Conway's Game of Life using TypeScript and the Processing P5.js library. 


### Playing the game:

To run it, be sure to have `npm` and `node.js` installed and execute this commands at the root of the project:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```


### How to use it:

There are for buttons: 

* **Play** - Starts the simulation
* **Pause** - Pauses the simulation
* **Reset** - Resets the grid
* **Randomize** - Applies random values across the grid

The game starts with a initial configuration but can load a preloaded one using the keys *1*, *2* or *3*, or you can click anywhere on the grid to add or remove cells.
